\subsection{Automatic Testing}\label{automatic-testing}

\begin{itemize}
  \item how were individual components \textbf{\emph{unit}-test}ed?
  \item how was communication, interaction, and/or integration among components tested?
  
  \item how to \textbf{\emph{end-to-end}-test} the system?
  %
  \begin{itemize}
    \item e.g.~production vs.~test environment
  \end{itemize}

  \item for each test specify:
  %
  \begin{itemize}
    \item rationale of individual tests
    \item how were the test automated
    \item how to run them
    \item which requirement they are testing, if any
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
recall that \emph{deployment} \textbf{automation} is commonly used to \emph{test} the system in \emph{production-like} environment
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
recall to test corner cases (crashes, errors, etc.)
\end{quote}

\subsection{Acceptance test}\label{acceptance-test}

\begin{itemize}
  \item did you perform any \emph{manual} testing?
  %
  \begin{itemize}
    \item what did you test?
    \item why wasn't it automatic?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
