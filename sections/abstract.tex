\section*{Abstract}\label{abstract}

We present a distributed, real-time Bomberman system designed for multi-player gameplay with scalability and fault tolerance. 
The architecture is split into two tiers: a hub layer responsible for matchmaking and cluster coordination, and a room layer that executes the authoritative game loop. 
The hub server adopts an AP-oriented design, using UDP-based gossip to disseminate room availability and peer liveness without centralized coordination.
The room server is CP-oriented, running a deterministic tick loop over a TCP and Protocol Buffers protocol to ensure consistent state across clients. 
The client is protocol-driven and renders the game as an ASCII interface.

The system supports transient failure handling through bounded reconnection windows and state snapshotting, keeping matches stable under brief network interruptions. 
A Kubernetes-based deployment is supported for hub scalability and room provisioning, with containerized services and a clear separation of responsibilities between components. 
The result is a coherent distributed design that balances availability with strong consistency at the game engine.
