\section{Self-evaluation}\label{self-evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item An individual section is required for each member of the group
  \item Each member must self-evaluate their work, listing the strengths and weaknesses of the product
  \item Each member must describe their role within the group as objectively as possible.
\end{itemize}

It should be noted that each student is only responsible for their own section.
