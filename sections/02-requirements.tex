\section{Requirements Elicitation and Analysis}\label{requirements}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The requirements must explain \textbf{what} (not how) the software
  being produced should do.
  %
  \begin{itemize}
    \item you should not focus on the particular problems, but exclusively on
    what you want the application to do.
  \end{itemize}

  \item Requirements must be clearly identified, and possibly numbered

  \item Requirements are divided into:
  %
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Functional}: some functionality the software should provide to the user

    \item \textbf{Non-functional}: requirements that do not directly concern behavioural aspects, such as consistency, availability, etc.

    \item \textbf{Implementation}: constrain the entire phase of system realization, 
    for instance by requiring the use of a specific programming language and/or a specific software tool
    %
    \begin{itemize}
      \item these constraints should be adequately justified by political / economic / administrative reasons\ldots{}
      \item \ldots{} otherwise, implementation choices should emerge \emph{as  a consequence of} design
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  \item If there are domain-specific terms, these should be explained in a glossary
  
  \item Each requirement must have its own \textbf{acceptance criterion}
  %
  \begin{itemize}
    \item these will be important for the validation phase
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevant Distributed System Features}
\label{ds-features}

Motivate which distributed system features are relevant for your project, and which are not.
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item transparency
  \begin{itemize}
    \item does your system need to hide distribution details from users or developers?
    \item is it important that failures, location, or replication are invisible?
  \end{itemize}

  \item fault tolerance, dependability -- availability, reliability, integrity, maintainability, safety
  \begin{itemize}
    \item what happens if a component fails?
    is uninterrupted service required?
    \item is data loss or corruption unacceptable?
    \item how quickly must the system recover from faults?
  \end{itemize}

  \item scalability
  \begin{itemize}
    \item will the system need to handle increasing numbers of users, requests, or data?
    \item is it expected to grow over time?
  \end{itemize}

  \item security, trust
  \begin{itemize}
    \item is sensitive data being processed or stored?
    \item are there multiple user roles with different permissions?
    \item is authentication or authorization required?
  \end{itemize}

  \item resource sharing
  \begin{itemize}
    \item do multiple users or components need access to shared resources?
    \item is coordination or synchronization needed?
  \end{itemize}

  \item openness, interoperability, heterogeneity of components
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Will your system interact with external systems or use components built with different technologies?
    \item Is standardization or compatibility important?
  \end{itemize}

  \item evolvability, maintainability
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Will the system need to be updated or extended after deployment?
    \item Is long-term maintenance a concern?
  \end{itemize}

  \item performance, concurrency, computation / communication efficiency, bandwidth
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Are there strict requirements on response time or throughput?
    \item Will many operations happen in parallel?
    \item Is network usage a concern?
  \end{itemize}

  \item economy, costs  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Are there budget constraints for development, deployment, or operation?
    \item Is minimizing resource usage important?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
